    "# Basic Model\n",

    "<p>1. It is about the number of a certain incident over a given time period or area or population...</p>\n",

    "<p>3. The number of incident is not correlated to the previous history. </p>\n",
    "<p>4. The probabiity of a single incident is small (rare event).</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "In the standard ols case we often assume that $y$ is generated from normal distribution (distribution parameter is a function of $x$). However, if the $y$ has the above characterisitics and we want to see the effect of $x$ on $y$, it is better to assume that $y$ is generated from poisson distriution, with parameter as a function of $x$.</p>\n",

    "# Poisson Regression with variable exposure\n",
    "A natural concern about the above model is that, since we are focusing on the number of incidents in a given interval of time (or given amount of population), we should keep such 'unit' as same across individuals. However, in reality this is not always the case. For example, we want to see the determinants of the number of patients of a dicease, using city-level data. One concern is that, a city with larger population tends to have more patients (given other thing same). Also, cities with longer investigation interval tends to have more patients. Therefore we want to incorporate the 'unit' or 'Exposure'$T_i$ into our model.i.e., \n",
