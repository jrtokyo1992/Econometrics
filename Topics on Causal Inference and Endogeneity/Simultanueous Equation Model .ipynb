We call this simplified equation system. Separately estimating each equation in this simplified system brings consistent estimation on $\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\gamma_1, \\gamma_2$\n",
    "\n",
    "But what we care more about is the original parameters $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_3, \\alpha_1, \\alpha_2, \\alpha_3$. This is impossible: We only have four new parameters (i.e., four equations for the original parameters) in the simplied system, but we have six original paramters ! This makes the original parameters unidentifiable. Unless two additional constraints (equations) are imposed on original parameters, we cannot estimate the original parameters.\n",

    "Then how to impose another two restrictions? A simple way is to directly put some parameters to zero. For example, we can impose $\\alpha_2=0$, which means we 'exclude ' the $x$ in the equation (1). But of course only one additional restriction is not enough;  we need one more restriction. We next discuss different possible cases."
