Therefore, often times, in the multiple logit model, $x$ often represents a set of invidiual characteristics, which does not change with specific choices. But this is not always the case. For example, when we choose from means of transportation, the time we spend on transportation matters. For the same person, he may spend different times on different means of transportation. This implies that the varaible 'transporation time', a variable that may affects individual's choice, actually changes with the choice. Therefore, we write such variables are $z_{ij}$, since they changes with individuals and choices. That is \n",

This assumption, however, may not be realistic, especially when the two plans looks very similar. For example, plan A is taking a red bus, while plan B is taking a blue bus.Since thse two choices are very similar,  It is quite possible that some unservable factors affecting the utility on plan A also affect the utility on plan B.
