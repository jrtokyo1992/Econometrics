    "# Introduction\n",
    "In the econometric textbook, we encounter cases where the information of $y$ of some sample are missing, making it impossible to directly infer from these samples. There are various scenarios and models: truncated regression, sample selection model, tobit model, and hurdle model... In this text, however, I first show that all these models share the same framework and idea by introducing a general setting and estimating strategy. The various models can be derived by making specific assumptions on the function form and the distribution of the error term on the general setting."

When $w_i =0$, the $y^*_i$ cannot be observed: either it directly disappear (truncated), or it becomes a constant value (censored). Here I use 'abnormal' to informally describe such a situation. in either way, we cannot get the information the $y^*_i$. $u_i$ and $v_i$ follows some joint distribution.We discuss the following two cases. \n",

    "<p>An alternative estimation strategy is to use NLS (specify a non-linear function of $z$ and a linear function of $x$ in the model). Another estimating strategy is to use MLE. Since we can only observe the information of those with $w_i=1$,when writing down the likelihood function for each individual $i$, we need to condition on $w_i=1$.\n",
    "$$L_i(y=y_i, x_i, z_i) \\equiv pr(y=y_i | w_i =1,z_i,x_i)= \\frac{pr(y =y_i, w_i=1| z_i,x_i)}{pr(w_i =1 | w_i, x_i)}$$\n",

Of course, if we know the distribution speficification of $\\epsilon_i$ and $v_i$ but do not know the distribution parameters, we can estimate these distribution parameters along with $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ simultaneously in the MLE.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Case 2: Sample with y='abnormal' still have observable $z$ and $x$\n",

    "   <p> If we define 'abnormal' as being censored at a level (i.e., $y_i=c$ when $w_i=0$) so that we cannot observe its real $y$, i.e., $y^*_i$, then the true conditional expectation of $y$ for the whole sample ($w_i=1$ and $w_i=0$) is \n",
    "$$E(y_i | x_i,z_i)= E(y_i |x_i, w_i =1)pr(w_i =1 |z_i)+ E(y_i|x_i,w_i =0)pr(w_i =0 |z_i)$$\n",

    "Again, this true model is a linear function of $x_i$ and a non-linear function of $z_i$. A simple linear regression using $x_i$ is not a good idea, and we may need NLS or MLE to estimate.\n",
    "When doing MLE, we can write down the the likelihood function of individual $i$ as \n",

    "This is straight forward. If $w_i=1$, then individual $i$ provides valid information on $w_i$ and $y^*_i$, so we can get its likelihood as $pr(y =y_i, w_i=1| z_i,x_i) $.
