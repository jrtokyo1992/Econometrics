    "# Cox Model \n",
    "A common disadvantage of the PH or AFT models is that they all assume a specific functional form of the baseline harzard $\\lambda_0$. However, avoiding a specification of $\\lambda_0(t)$ may be a good idea. <b>First,  it reduces the potential risk of model misspecification. Second, in fact we may not care too much about the baseline hazard. What we care most is, 'why did this guy spend less time on job search on that guy did?',i.e., we are interested in the relative difference of the harzard, and how such difference can be explained by the independent variables. </b> To better illustrate this , let's go back to PH model, and see that\n",

    "That is to say, the ratio of hazard between $i$ and $j$ only depends on $x$ and $\\beta$. This provides a new idea for writing likelihood function. \n",
    "## A Working Example\n",

    "Here we have four individuals. Indivual 1 finds a job 2 months after he graduates, $t_1=2$.Individual 2 finds a job 3 months after he graduates, $t_2=3$.. In the basic model we write down the following likelihood function\n",
    "$$f(t_1=2|x_1)f(t_2=3|x_2)f(t_3=6|x_3)f(t_4=12|x_4) \\tag{2}$$\n",

    "The above table, however, provides some other information on the 'order' of finding a job.Denote event: <b>1 finds job fastest, 2 the second , the 3 the third, and the 4 the slowest</b>. denote the probability of this Event as $p$. What is the expression of $p$?\n",
    "- For $t=2$, i.e, two months after each person's graduation, we know that among 1,2,3,4, There is one person that finds a job. Which one? It is 1.Denote $p_1:=$ the probality that 1 finds a job <b>given that there is one person in 1,2,3,4 that finds a job</b> \n",

    "<b>Since we have Proportional hazard, the baseline hazard disappears from both the nominator and denominator.</b> Given this, we can write down the the expression of $p$ immediately.<b> To summarize, this $p$ captures the probability for the observed 'order' of the job finding, but not the absolute time point.

It is quite reasonable that male and female have different baseline hazards,meaning that gender variable cannot be sepearated from the baseline harzard, and we can no longer kill the baseline harzard part from the likelihood function. \n",
    "<p>One method, naturally, is to allow for difference in the baseline harzard for male $\\lambda^m_0(t)$ and for female $\\lambda^f_0(t)$, and write down the partial likelihood function for male and men respectively. The harzard for male and female are respectively:\n",

    "    To be specific, for male, we consider the relative order of finding a job among the male, and write down the likelihood  function. male have common baseline hazard function, there we can get a likelihood function independent of baseline hazard. The same is for female. Intuitively, there are two main disadvantages in this approach.</p>\n",
